# TARDIS 2.0

## Changes in 2.7.0
- generate std plots in screening phase
- works also when user inputs a qc_pattern that is not "QC"
- added smoothing parameter "smoothing_order" for the smoothing function

## Changes in 2.6.1
- Fixed bugs (smoothing function null handling)

## Changes in 2.6.0
- Fixed plotting issues (null values handled wrongly by previous imputation step)
- Added pval_cutoff parameter to GUI and functions

## Changes in 2.5.0
- Fixed null handling by linear imputation of missing values
- No null plots!

## Changes in 2.4.0.2
- Fixed logic in rtAlignment() function (retention time alignment)

## Changes in 2.4.0b
- Fixed issue: detecting overlapping peaks
- Code detects unimodal/multimodal distribution and detects peak accordingly

## Changes in 2.3.0b
- Fixed issue: retention time alignment
- Retention time is aligned, then shifted to the correct retention time.

## Changes in 2.2.0b
- Fixed issue: detecting only the highest peak
- Ignore local maxima that is lower than 10% of the maximum peak intensity, not 50% (previous)

## Changes in 2.1.0b
- Improved algorithm efficiency and parallel computing code
- Achieved lower runtime in comparison to the original code by Pablo

## Changes in 2.0.0b
- Fixed 'missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed' crash in `tardisPeaks`.
- Added robust handling for empty GUI inputs.

## Changes in 2.0.0
- Edited peakdet.R and peaks_with_tardis.R
- Added functions for repetitive code
- Fixed issue: detecting only one peak in two overlapping peaks
- Implemented parallel processing in tardisPeaks function (the number of cores need to be specified in the user interface)
- Fixed issue (still needs improvement): some peaks get cut off the sides of the plot window
- Implemented baseline correction to smoothing method
- Created newSmoothing.R: a new smoothing function (not implemented in main function)
